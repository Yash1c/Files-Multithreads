# üìù Text File Character Counter

**Subject:** Performance in Cyber-Physical Systems
**Author:** Guilherme Montoya (Yashic)

A Java program that counts character occurrences in `.txt` files from a directory, using **multithreading** for optimized performance.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ **Multithreaded processing** for efficient file reading
* ‚úÖ Character frequency counting (A-Z, case insensitive)
* ‚úÖ Execution time measurement
* ‚úÖ Optimized for both small (100 files) and large (35,000 files) datasets
* ‚úÖ Automatic thread count based on available processors

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### üìÇ Core Logic

1. **File Discovery:**
   Scans the specified directory for `.txt` files.

2. **Thread Management:**

   * Files are evenly divided into batches.
   * Each thread processes its assigned batch.

3. **Character Counting:**

   * Converts text to uppercase.
   * Counts occurrences of characters A-Z, ignoring others.

4. **Result Aggregation:**

   * Merges results from all threads.
   * Displays final character counts and processing statistics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Thread Optimization

The number of threads is automatically calculated based on the number of available processors:

```java
int numThreads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
```

You can also manually set the thread count if desired.

## üìä Visual Representation of Processing

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[.txt Files in Directory] --> B{Split into Batches}
    B --> C1[Thread 1]
    B --> C2[Thread 2]
    B --> C3[...]
    B --> Cn[Thread N]
    
    C1 --> D1[Count Characters]
    C2 --> D2[Count Characters]
    C3 --> D3[Count Characters]
    Cn --> Dn[Count Characters]

    D1 --> E[Aggregate Results]
    D2 --> E
    D3 --> E
    Dn --> E

    E --> F[Display Final Counts and Execution Time]
```

This diagram illustrates how the files are divided among multiple threads, each counting characters in parallel, and finally aggregating the results.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Considerations

* ‚úÖ Tested with both sample (100 files) and production (35,000 files) datasets.
* ‚úÖ Thread count can be adjusted for specific hardware configurations.
* ‚úÖ Execution time is displayed for benchmarking purposes.

## üèÅ How to Use

1. Unzip the folders:
```
-------------------------------------------------------
Current dir: /user/path/project/All
-------------------------------------------------------
```
```bash
unzip sample.zip
```
```
-------------------------------------------------------
Current dir: /user/path/project/All
-------------------------------------------------------
```
```bash
unzip all_files.zip
```

2. Compile the program:
```bash
javac Main.java
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
java Main
```

4. View the output in the console:

   * Total number of files processed.
   * Successfully processed files.
   * Files with errors (if any).
   * Character frequency counts.
   * Total execution time.

## üì¶ Code Structure

```java
public class CharacterCounter {
    // Main components:
    // - File discovery and validation
    // - Thread creation and management
    // - Character counting logic

## üîß Technical Notes

* Case-insensitive counting: A-Z treated the same as a-z.
* Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.
* Efficient file handling using `java.nio` and buffered reading.
* Designed for modern multi-core processors for maximum performance.
